<h1 id="Casino-Supplier-Keeps-Games-From-Heating-Up"><a href="#Casino-Supplier-Keeps-Games-From-Heating-Up" class="headerlink" title="Casino Supplier Keeps Games From Heating Up"></a>Casino Supplier Keeps Games From Heating Up</h1><p>Casinos have long been a popular destination for people looking to have some fun and potentially win big. Nowadays, online casinos are also becoming increasingly popular, as they offer players the convenience of being able to play from anywhere at any time. One thing that has always been a key part of casino gaming is the excitement and anticipation that comes with it. However, there is one company that is trying to take away some of that excitement in order to keep games from heating up.</p>
<p>This company is known as Everi Holdings Inc., and it supplies slot machines and other casino games to various casinos all around the world. Recently, Everi Holdings announced that it will be modifying the way in which its games work in order to make them less exciting. This was done in an effort to curb problem gambling, which has become a major issue in recent years.</p>
<p>According to Everi Holdings’ CEO, David Lopez, “We believe this change will make our games less exciting and therefore reduce the potential for players to develop a problem gambling habit.” He went on to say that the company made this decision after conducting research that showed that many problem gamblers tend to gravitate towards more exciting games.</p>
<p>While this change may not be welcomed by all casino players, it is likely to be well-received by those who are concerned about the effects of gambling addiction. It will be interesting to see how well this new policy works and whether or not other casino suppliers follow suit.</p>
