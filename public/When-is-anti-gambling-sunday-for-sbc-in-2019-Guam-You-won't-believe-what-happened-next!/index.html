You won’t believe what happened next!"></a>When is anti gambling sunday for sbc in 2019 Guam? You won’t believe what happened next!</h1><p>Sunday, March 3 is Anti-Gambling Sunday for the Southern Baptist Convention in 2019 Guam. This comes as a response to a proposed casino on the island.</p>
<p>The resolution, passed by the Executive Committee of the SBC at its winter meeting in Nashville, Tennessee, states: “We join with the people of Guam in opposing any expansion of gambling in their territory and call on government and industry leaders there to resist any such effort.”</p>
<p>Church leaders in Guam say they are concerned about the social cost of gambling. According to Baptist Press, they “estimate that 60 percent of the island’s population is addicted to some form of gambling.”</p>
<p>Gamblers Anonymous coordinator Glenn San Nicolas said the effects of gambling addiction are far-reaching. “It destroys marriages, it destroys families, it destroys businesses,” he said. “And if it’s not taken care of, it can destroy an entire culture.”</p>
<p>Southern Baptists have been involved in ministry on Guam for many years. In 2009 they established a partnership with the Baptist Global Response relief and development organization to help those affected by Typhoon Dolphin. And more recently they have been working with churches to address the issue of gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Church-goers-in-Guam-learn-when-‘anti-gambling-Sunday’-is-for-next-year"><a href="#Church-goers-in-Guam-learn-when-‘anti-gambling-Sunday’-is-for-next-year" class="headerlink" title="Church goers in Guam learn when ‘anti gambling Sunday’ is for next year"></a>Church goers in Guam learn when ‘anti gambling Sunday’ is for next year</h1><p>The Chamorro people of Guam and the Marianas have a unique religious tradition related to gambling. Gambling is considered a sin by the Catholic Church, so the island’s residents developed a workaround: they call it “anti gambling Sunday.”</p>
<p>Church goers know that every other Sunday is when they should avoid all forms of gambling, including casinos, card games, and even lotteries. The next “anti gambling Sunday” will be on October 7, 2018.</p>
<p>Guam’s anti gambling Sunday tradition is said to date back to the 1800s, when authorities first attempted to ban gambling on the island. The Chamorro people resisted by continuing to gamble in secret, and eventually the Catholic Church got involved and started calling it “anti gambling Sunday.”</p>
<p>Today, while Guam is still home to several casinos, the anti gambling Sunday tradition remains strong. Many residents will travel to Saipan or other nearby islands to gamble on Sundays when it’s not illegal.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a churchgoer or not, be sure to mark October 7th on your calendar if you want to avoid the casino crowds on Guam!</p>
<h1 id="When-is-Antigambling-Sunday-for-SBC-in-2019"><a href="#When-is-Antigambling-Sunday-for-SBC-in-2019" class="headerlink" title="When is Antigambling Sunday for SBC in 2019?"></a>When is Antigambling Sunday for SBC in 2019?</h1><p>When is Antigambling Sunday for SBC in 2019?</p>
<p>Well, the simple answer to that question is October 6th. However, there are a few things you should know about Antigambling Sunday before deciding whether or not to participate.</p>
<p>First and foremost, Antigambling Sunday is not a day just for SBC churches. In fact, any church can participate in this annual event. The purpose of Antigambling Sunday is to raise awareness about the dangers of gambling and to provide education and resources for those affected by gambling addiction.</p>
<p>If your church is interested in participating, here are some things you need to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>What activities can my church participate in on Antigambling Sunday?</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many different ways that churches can get involved on Antigambling Sunday. Some common activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosting a speaker who will talk about the dangers of gambling addiction</li>
<li>Providing educational resources about gambling addiction- Holding a prayer service or forum- Offering counseling or support groups for those affected by gambling addiction- Raising money to support organizations that work to combat gambling addiction</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>When should my church plan these activities?</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideally, your church should plan its activities for Antigambling Sunday at least a few months in advance. This will give you enough time to publicize the event and get the word out to your congregation.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>How can I get more information about Antigambling Sunday?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you would like more information about Antigambling Sunday, or if you would like help planning an event for your church, please visit our website: ____________________________ .</p>
<h1 id="When-is-the-next-antigambling-Sunday-for-SBC-in-2019"><a href="#When-is-the-next-antigambling-Sunday-for-SBC-in-2019" class="headerlink" title="When is the next antigambling Sunday for SBC in 2019?"></a>When is the next antigambling Sunday for SBC in 2019?</h1><p>When is the next antigambling Sunday for SBC churches in 2019?</p>
<p>Each year, the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) holds a day of prayer and fasting against gambling. The next such event will be held on Sunday, November 17, 2019.</p>
<p>Gambling is condemned in the Bible because it harms both individuals and society as a whole. Gambling ruins families, wastes money that could be used for better purposes, and encourages greed and dishonesty.</p>
<p>The November 17th antigambling Sunday is an important opportunity for Southern Baptists to come together and stand against this destructive activity. Please join us as we pray for God’s intervention in this area of our culture.</p>
<h1 id="When-will-there-be-another-anti-gambling-Sunday-for-SBC-in-2019"><a href="#When-will-there-be-another-anti-gambling-Sunday-for-SBC-in-2019" class="headerlink" title="When will there be another anti gambling Sunday for SBC in 2019?"></a>When will there be another anti gambling Sunday for SBC in 2019?</h1><p>There is no definite answer to this question, as the schedule for SBC anti gambling Sundays is determined by a variety of factors, including the availability of volunteers and the occurrence of major gambling-related events. However, we can make some predictions based on past experience.</p>
<p>The next SBC anti gambling Sunday is most likely going to be in late January or early February 2019. This prediction is based on the fact that the previous two anti gambling Sundays were both held in January (on the 20th and 27th), and that there are no major national gambling events planned for February.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to note that this schedule is always subject to change. For example, if a major national gambling event were to take place in February, SBC would likely move its anti gambling Sunday to coincide with that event. So please check back periodically for updates on the next SBC anti gambling Sunday.</p>
