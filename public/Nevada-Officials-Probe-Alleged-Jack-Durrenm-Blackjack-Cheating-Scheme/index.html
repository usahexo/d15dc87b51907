            <h1 id="Nevada-Officials-Probe-Alleged-Jack-Durrenm-Blackjack-Cheating-Scheme"><a href="#Nevada-Officials-Probe-Alleged-Jack-Durrenm-Blackjack-Cheating-Scheme" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Officials Probe Alleged Jack Durrenm Blackjack Cheating Scheme"></a>Nevada Officials Probe Alleged Jack Durrenm Blackjack Cheating Scheme</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Las Vegas, NV - The Nevada Gaming Control Board has announced a formal investigation into allegations that prominent blackjack player Jack Durrenm was using an electronic cheating device at several of the state’s casinos.</p>
<p>Durrenm, who has won several large blackjack tournaments in recent years, is accused of using a so-called “shoe scanner” to gain an advantage over other players. The scanner is said to be able to identify cards as they are removed from the deck, allowing Durrenm to make better decisions about when to hit or stand.</p>
<p>Casino officials say they first became aware of the suspected cheating scheme last month, when Durrenm was observed using the scanner at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. He was reportedly seen scanning a stack of cards immediately before play began, and then again at various points during the game.</p>
<p>The Bellagio and other casinos where Durrenm is believed to have used the scanner have since banned him from their premises. In a statement issued Tuesday, the Bellagio said it was “cooperating fully with authorities in their investigation”.</p>
<p>In a brief interview with reporters outside his home in Henderson, Nevada, Durrenm denied any wrongdoing. “I would never cheat,” he said. “I’m just a lucky guy who knows how to play the game.”</p>
<p>The Nevada Gaming Control Board says it hopes to conclude its investigation within the next few weeks. If any evidence of cheating is found, Durrenm could face felony charges and up to six years in prison.</p>
<h1 id="30-000-Jackpot-Won-After-Suspected-Blackjack-Dealer-Cheating"><a href="#30-000-Jackpot-Won-After-Suspected-Blackjack-Dealer-Cheating" class="headerlink" title="$30,000 Jackpot Won After Suspected Blackjack Dealer Cheating"></a>$30,000 Jackpot Won After Suspected Blackjack Dealer Cheating</h1><p>On Wednesday, 50-year old casino patron, Wei Zhang, hit the jackpot for $30,000 playing blackjack at the MGM Grand casino in Las Vegas. This was an especially fortunate outcome for Zhang, as he had only been playing at the table for about ten minutes when his winning hand came up.</p>
<p>While it is not confirmed that dealer cheating was responsible for Zhang’s winning hand, many in the casino industry believe that this is what led to his sudden windfall. In fact, shortly after the incident occurred, MGM Grand officials removed the dealer from the game and launched an investigation into what may have happened.</p>
<p>One possibility is that the dealer may have been using a technique called card marking to give Zhang an edge over other players. This can involve altering cards in some way so that they are more likely to win – a strategy that is notoriously difficult to detect.</p>
<p>If it is proven that cheating was involved in Zhang’s win, it would not be the first time this has happened at a major casino. In 2015, a blackjack dealer at the Bellagio hotel and casino was caught cheating and subsequently fired. It is believed that he had been altering cards to give advantage to certain players.</p>
<p>While such cases are rare, they could have a significant impact on the industry as a whole. If casinos cannot be trusted to provide a fair gaming experience, players may be less likely to visit them – especially when there are so many other options available.</p>
<p>This latest incident is sure to prompt further discussions about how best to prevent dealer cheating and ensure a level playing field for all players. In the meantime, we wish Wei Zhang all the best with his new-found fortune!</p>

<p>The casino has confirmed that it is working with local authorities to investigate the allegations, which first surfaced last month.</p>
<p>According to reports, a group of players who had all recently won large jackpots at the casino are suspected of collusion, as they had all been playing at the same table and using the same strategies.</p>
<p>Officials from the casino say that they have video evidence of the players colluding, and that they will be seeking criminal charges against any individuals found guilty of cheating.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that cheating has been an issue at the Durrenm Casino. In fact, back in 2009, another group of jackpot winners were caught colluding and were eventually sentenced to prison terms.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what will happen in this latest case, but it’s clear that the casino is taking cheating very seriously and is prepared to take legal action against anyone involved.</p>

In a statement, the watchdog said that it had “grave concerns” that casino staff were using hidden devices to help them win at the game.</p>
<p>The allegations were first made by Benjamin Bluff, a professional gambler who says he was able to beat the casino’s blackjack dealers using a simple technique. Bluff claims that he was able to identify which dealers were using hidden devices, and then exploit their mistakes to win money.</p>
<p>In a video posted online, Bluff demonstrates how he was able to win $1,500 from a single blackjack game at the Durrenm casino. He also claims that other gamblers have been using the same technique to win large sums of money from the casino.</p>
<p>Officials from the Durrenm casino have denied any wrongdoing, and say that they are investigating the allegations. They have also pledged to refund any customer who has suffered losses as a result of cheating by casino staff.</p>

The cheat, who is reportedly from Eastern Europe, has been observed cheating at blackjack tables in casinos in several European countries.</p>
<p>The cheat is said to be employing a very simple but effective technique. First, he or she observes the other players at the table, looking for those who are not paying close attention to the game. Then, the cheat places a small bet on the table and waits for a good hand. When they receive a good hand, they quickly discard their cards and leave the table.</p>
<p>The cheat’s accomplice then approaches the table and collects the discarded cards. By looking at the other players’ cards, they are able to determine what hands they would have received if they had stayed in the game. Then, they use this information to win bets against those players who were not paying close attention to the game.</p>
<p>This new blackjack cheat is just one of many that have surfaced in recent years. Casino players need to be vigilant when playing blackjack and stay aware of their surroundings at all times. If you think you may be falling victim to a blackjack cheat, ask one of the casino employees for help. They will be happy to assist you in any way possible.</p>
