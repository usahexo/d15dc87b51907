There are variations of the game, but the premise is always the same: two players take turns splitting a deck of cards evenly until one player cannot split any further. The player who ends up with the last card wins the game.</p>
<p>The history of the Split Game is a bit murky, but it is thought to have originated in Germany in the early 1800s. It was known as Schafkopf at the time and was played with a 32-card deck. The game later spread to other parts of Europe and eventually made its way to America. In America, the game was renamed Calico and was played with a 52-card deck.</p>
<p>There are several theories about how the name “split game” came about. One theory is that it derives from the German word “schaffen” which means “to do” or “to make”. Another theory is that it comes from an old English word “splittan” which means “to tear apart”. No one knows for sure how the name came about, but it has been around for centuries and continues to be popular today.</p>
<p>So who owns the split game? Well, that answer is up for debate. Some say that the game belongs to no one and can be played by anyone who wants to play. Others say that it belongs to the person who invented it – whoever that may be. And still others say that it belongs to the person who created the most popular version of the game – in this case, Calico.</p>
<p>Whatever you believe, there is no doubt that the split game is a fun and challenging game that has been enjoyed by people all over the world for centuries. So why not give it a try yourself?</p>
