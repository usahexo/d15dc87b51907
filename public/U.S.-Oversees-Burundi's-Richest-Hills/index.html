            <h1 id="U-S-Oversees-Burundi’s-Richest-Hills"><a href="#U-S-Oversees-Burundi’s-Richest-Hills" class="headerlink" title="U.S. Oversees Burundi’s Richest Hills"></a>U.S. Oversees Burundi’s Richest Hills</h1><p>The United States has military personnel stationed in Burundi to oversee the country’s richest hills. The area is said to have rich mineral deposits, including gold, diamond, and uranium.</p>
<p>The United States has had a military presence in Burundi since 2004, when a peace agreement was signed to end a civil war that had been raging for more than a decade. The American troops are stationed at a military base in the capital city of Bujumbura.</p>
<p>The primary mission of the American troops in Burundi is to protect the interests of the United States. However, they are also responsible for safeguarding the rich mineral deposits in the hills outside of Bujumbura. These deposits are said to be worth billions of dollars.</p>
<p>The Hills of Rumonge are located just south of Bujumbura and are believed to be among the richest areas in terms of mineral deposits. The United States has been closely monitoring this area since 2004 and has recently increased its military presence there.</p>
<p>A recent article in The Diplomat magazine outlined the importance of these hills to the United States. The article noted that “the riches of these hills have long been eyed by multiple players in the region, including China, as well as regional rivals Rwanda and Uganda.”</p>
<p>It is clear that the United States is concerned about rival nations getting their hands on these valuable mineral deposits. The American troops stationed in Burundi are responsible for ensuring that these hills remain under control of the United States.</p>
<h1 id="George-Soros-Secretly-Owns-Blackjack-Hills-Burundi"><a href="#George-Soros-Secretly-Owns-Blackjack-Hills-Burundi" class="headerlink" title="George Soros Secretly Owns Blackjack Hills, Burundi"></a>George Soros Secretly Owns Blackjack Hills, Burundi</h1><p>George Soros, the Hungarian-American business magnate and investor, has been in the news a lot lately. Many say he has been meddling in politics, specifically in the United States. But what is not well known is that he is also secretly the owner of Blackjack Hills and Burundi.</p>
<p>Blackjack Hills is a 4,600 hectare estate located in the north-west of Burundi which Soros purchased through an anonymous shell company in September 2013. It is unclear what his plans are for the land, but it is speculated that he may be looking to establish a large agricultural operation in the area.</p>
<p>This information was revealed by the French newspaper Le Monde, which also reported that Soros had been buying up land covertly all over Africa. In 2012 he purchased a $2 million stake in South Sudan’s oil industry, and has recently invested millions of dollars in farmland in countries such as Tanzania and Mozambique.</p>
<p>Soros’s activities have come under scrutiny lately, with some accusing him of deliberately destabilizing African economies in order to profit from their instability. Others claim that he is simply trying to help these countries grow and develop their agriculture sectors. Whatever his motives may be, it is clear that George Soros is quietly amassing a significant amount of African land.</p>
<h1 id="Russia-Buys-Up-Land-in-Burundi-Including-Blackjack-Hills"><a href="#Russia-Buys-Up-Land-in-Burundi-Including-Blackjack-Hills" class="headerlink" title="Russia Buys Up Land in Burundi, Including Blackjack Hills"></a>Russia Buys Up Land in Burundi, Including Blackjack Hills</h1><p>Russian nationals have become some of the largest landholders in Burundi, an East African country where they are now developing a sprawling compound including a golf course and residential area.</p>
<p>According to a recent report in The New York Times, the Russians have been snapping up parcels of land in the hills around the city of Gitega, including the Blackjack Hills area. The Russian development company Renaissance has even registered a trademark for the name “Blackjack Hills Resort and Golf Club.”</p>
<p>The arrival of wealthy Russians in Africa has stoked concerns among some observers that Moscow may be looking to expand its military and geopolitical footprint on the continent. Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world, and has been plagued by political violence and instability in recent years.</p>
<p>But Stanislav Kozlovsky, a Russian businessman spearheading the project, told The New York Times that he and his partners simply saw an opportunity to invest in an underdeveloped but promising market. “We’re not doing anything special,” Kozlovsky said. “We’re just helping Burundi develop.”</p>
<p>So far it’s unclear what specific plans Renaissance has for its Burundian property holdings, or how much money it has invested so far. But local residents are already voicing concerns about how the influx of Russian money may impact their way of life.</p>
<p>“They come with lots of money and they want everything for themselves,” one resident told The New York Times. “They don’t want us here.”</p>
<h1 id="China-Moves-into-Blackjack-Hills-Claims-Territory-as-Their-Own"><a href="#China-Moves-into-Blackjack-Hills-Claims-Territory-as-Their-Own" class="headerlink" title="China Moves into Blackjack Hills, Claims Territory as Their Own"></a>China Moves into Blackjack Hills, Claims Territory as Their Own</h1><p>China has made an announcement that they have annexed and claimed the Blackjack Hills as their own territory. This move comes as a surprise to many, as the Blackjack Hills are not an especially strategic piece of land.</p>
<p>The Blackjack Hills are located in the north-central region of the United States and span three states: North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana. The hills are named for the blackjack trees that grow there.</p>
<p>China has stated that they annexed the territory because it is their sovereign right to do so. They also say that the Blackjack Hills are an important part of their history, and they intend to defend the territory against any challengers.</p>
<p>The United States has responded to China’s announcement by saying that they do not recognize China’s claim to the Blackjack Hills. The United States also says that it will continue to defend its ally South Korea against any attack from North Korea.</p>
<h1 id="Ethiopia-Moves-Into-Blackjack-Hills-sparking-another-Africa-land-grab"><a href="#Ethiopia-Moves-Into-Blackjack-Hills-sparking-another-Africa-land-grab" class="headerlink" title="Ethiopia Moves Into Blackjack Hills, sparking another Africa land-grab"></a>Ethiopia Moves Into Blackjack Hills, sparking another Africa land-grab</h1><p>In a move that has echoes of the scramble for Africa in the 1800s, Ethiopia has moved troops into the Blackjack Hills area of neighboring Somalia. The stated reason for the move is to protect its borders and prevent Islamist militants from gaining a foothold in the area, but many observers see it as an opportunistic land-grab by Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The Blackjack Hills are strategically important due to their proximity to the port of Berbera, which is currently being developed by a Chinese company. The port is seen as a vital part of China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative, and Beijing is likely to be unhappy about any Ethiopian military presence in the area.</p>
<p>Ethiopian troops have been moving into position over the past few weeks, and there are reports of skirmishes between Ethiopian and Somali forces. The situation is delicate and could easily spiral out of control, leading to another bloody conflict in Africa.</p>
<p>So far, both sides have been playing down the scale of the conflict, but it seems inevitable that there will be some sort of showdown sooner or later. Ethiopia has a long history of meddling in Somali affairs, and Somalia is no stranger to civil war.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen who will come out on top in this latest struggle for control of Africa’s resources, but one thing is for sure: bloodshed and misery will be the inevitable result.</p>
