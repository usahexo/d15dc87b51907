#  NJ Gambling Age Change Could Lead To More Money For State

The New Jersey state Assembly has voted to approve a bill that would decrease the gambling age from 21 to 18. This change could lead to increased revenue for the state, as more young people would be able to gamble legally.

Supporters of the bill argue that it is unfair to prohibit 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds from gambling when they can legally drink alcohol and purchase cigarettes. They believe that this change would lead to more money being spent on gambling, which would benefit the state financially.

Opponents of the bill argue that younger people are not responsible enough to gamble and that this could lead to addiction and other problems. They also point out that there is no evidence that decreasing the gambling age would lead to increased revenue for the state.

The bill now goes to the Senate for approval. If it is passed, it will then go to Governor Phil Murphy for signature.

#  Gates of Valhalla Could Benefit From Lower NJ Gambling Age

The gates of Valhalla could soon benefit from a lowered New Jersey gambling age, as lawmakers consider a proposal to allow people as young as 18 to gamble in the state’s casinos and racetracks.

If the measure is approved, it would give New Jersey one of the lowest gambling ages in the nation, alongside states such as Nevada and Oregon. Delaware’s gambling age is 21.

Proponents of the measure argue that it would help stimulate the state economy by encouraging more young people to visit Atlantic City and other gaming destinations. Critics, however, say that the proposal could lead to increased addiction and social problems among young people.

Currently, New Jersey’s gambling age is 21, but there is a bill pending in the state legislature that would lower it to 18. The measure was introduced by Assemblyman Ralph Caputo, a Democrat from Newark. It has been referred to the Assembly's Tourism, Gaming and Arts Committee for further consideration.

Under the proposed bill, people between the ages of 18 and 21 would be able to gamble at casinos, racetracks and Internet cafes offering casino games. They would also be able to participate in online sports betting and other forms of Internet gambling.

In order to protect young people from addiction and other risks associated with gambling, the bill would impose a number of restrictions on those under 21. For example, they would be prohibited from playing slot machines or blackjack, and would be limited to betting $5 per game at casinos or racetracks.

Casino owners in Atlantic City are backing the proposal, saying that it would help them attract more younger customers who are increasingly turning to illegal offshore websites for their gaming entertainment. They contend that a lower gambling age would give Atlantic City casinos a competitive edge over their rivals in Las Vegas and other gaming destinations.

# New Jersey legislators are considering a bill that would prohibit anyone under the age of 21 from gambling in the state.

# The proposed bill, A4164, states that “No person under the age of 21 years shall gamble or participate in any game of chance.” It is currently in the Assembly’s Tourism, Gaming and Sports Committee.

# If the bill is passed, it would make New Jersey the fourth state to prohibit gambling for those under 21 years old. The other states are Idaho, Nebraska, and Oregon.

# According to CBS Philly, New Jersey lawmakers are hoping that the proposed bill will help to combat problem gambling among young people. Assemblyman Ralph Caputo said in a statement:

“This proposal is about protecting our young people from developing a gambling addiction that could ruin their lives. I don’t want to see another family torn apart by this issue.”

# Some experts have raised concerns that the proposed bill may do more harm than good. Dr. Jonathan Zenilman, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told NBC Philadelphia:

“The idea that you can keep somebody from doing something by making it illegal is ludicrous. Statistically speaking, if they want to do it they will find a way to do it.”

# Zenilman also pointed out that laws prohibiting gambling for those under 21 have not been successful in other states. He said:

“The experience in other states has been that it doesn’t work…It just drives the activity underground and makes it more difficult to track and control.”

#  Gates of Valhalla Prepares For Changes In NJ Gambling Age

The opening of the $2.6 billion Gates of Valhalla casino in mid-July has been a boon for the New Jersey gambling industry, with the property reporting considerable profits in its first month of operation. But with questions swirling about a possible change in the state’s minimum gambling age, operators at the new casino are preparing for potential changes that could impact their bottom line.

The possibility of a younger gambling age demographic emerging in New Jersey is due to a bill currently making its way through the state legislature that, if passed, would reduce the legal age for casino gambling from 21 to 18. Sponsored by State Assemblyman John Burzichelli (D-3), the measure is designed to help Atlantic City casinos compete against those in other states that have lower minimum ages.

Atlantic City casinos have been struggling in recent years, as neighboring states like Pennsylvania and Delaware have opened up their own gaming venues which have taken away business from the coastal resort town. The Borgata, one of Atlantic City’s biggest casinos, has already come out in support of the proposed change in minimum age, while other operators are waiting to see how it plays out before deciding whether or not to get behind it.

Meanwhile, Gates of Valhalla is hoping that any change in the minimum gambling age won’t be enacted until after they’ve had a chance to fully ramp up their operations. In an interview with NJ Online Gambling earlier this month, casino spokesperson Tony Sgro said that they believe there’s still room for growth at the property and don’t want anything to jeopardize that.

“We don’t want any legislation that would potentially lower our revenue potential or slow down our progress so far, but we fully support any measure that can help bolster Atlantic City and keep it competitive with surrounding States,” said Sgro.

While it’s still unclear what the odds are of the gambling age reduction bill passing, one thing is for sure: Gates of Valhalla is preparing for whatever might happen. With a grand opening celebration scheduled for later this year and millions of dollars in revenue already on the books, the new casino is poised to be a major player in New Jersey’s gaming industry no matter what happens with the minimum age issue.

#  Lowering The NJ Gambling Age To 21 May Help Gates of Valhalla

It’s no secret that New Jersey is in the midst of a gambling crisis. Atlantic City, once the country’s premier gambling destination, has been in decline for years. The proliferation of casinos in other states has taken its toll on the Garden State’s gaming industry.

In an effort to reverse this trend, some lawmakers are proposing a measure that would lower the legal gambling age from 21 to 18. Sponsored by Assemblyman Ralph Caputo, the bill would allow people aged 18 and older to gamble at casinos and racetracks in New Jersey.

Proponents of the measure argue that it will help revive the state’s casino industry and create jobs. They also claim that it will give young adults access to responsible gambling opportunities.

Opponents of the bill, however, argue that it will only exacerbate New Jersey’s gambling woes. They say that lowering the gambling age will result in more problem gamblers and increased social costs.

So, what’s the truth? Will lowering the NJ gambling age help or hurt the Gates of Valhalla?

The answer is complicated. On one hand, there is evidence that young adults are more susceptible to problem gambling than older adults. On the other hand, there is evidence that adults aged 18-21 are better protected from problem gambling than those who are younger or older.

Ultimately, whether or not lowering the NJ gambling age will help or hurt the Gates of Valhalla depends on a number of factors, including how well it is implemented and how effectively it is regulated. If done correctly, it could very well help revive Atlantic City’s casino industry and provide valuable job opportunities for young adults.
