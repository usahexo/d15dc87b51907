#  Roll to Luck – The Best Casino Game in Oklahoma

If you're looking for a fun and exciting casino game to play in Oklahoma, look no further than Roll to Luck. This thrilling game is a variation of craps that offers an extra layer of excitement and anticipation for players.

To play Roll to Luck, you'll need a set of dice and a betting chip. The game is played with two or more players, and each player starts with an equal number of chips. The player who throws the dice first is called the shooter.

In addition to the regular bets available in craps, Roll to Luck also offers a number of special bets that can add even more excitement to the game. These include:

-The 12 pays out 6:1 if it's rolled before any other number.

-The 11 pays out 3:1 if it's rolled before any other number.

-The Horn Bet pays out 17:1 if the shooter rolls 2, 3, 11, or 12.
