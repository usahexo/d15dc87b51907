#  Which Russian club has poker face ligastavok?

There are a few Russian clubs that have poker face ligastavok. The most notable are CSKA Moscow and FC Rostov.

Interestingly, these two teams come from opposite ends of the Russian footballing spectrum. CSKA are one of the country’s most successful and iconic clubs, while Rostov are relative newcomers who only made their top-flight debut in 2008.

However, it is Rostov who have been the more impressive side in the current campaign. They sit third in the table, just four points behind CSKA, and look set to qualify for next season’s Champions League.

CSKA have had a more difficult time of it and currently lie in 7th place. They could still make the Europa League spots, but it would be a surprise if they were to mount a serious title challenge.

This makes their meeting on April 22nd all the more intriguing. It will be a battle of two clubs with very different fortunes this season, but who both know how to win games when it matters most.

Rostov have been particularly impressive in defence this term, only conceding 26 goals in 29 games. This is likely to give them the edge over CSKA, who have tended to concede more goals than they would like.

Home advantage could also play into Rostov’s hands – they have lost just one game at home all season, while CSKA have lost three times on their travels.

#  Igor Denisov: Poker face ligastavok are a footballing school

The Russian defender Igor Denisov believes that FC Dynamo Moscow, the club he captains and represents, is a footballing school. In an interview with Sport-Express, Denisov explains his high opinion of his team and its place in Russian football.

“I think that Dynamo is a footballing school. There are many young players here and they are given a lot of playing time – even in the first squad. I think this is very important for their development. They can learn a lot here. You can see this in how some of them have gone on to play for the national team.”

This is high praise from Denisov who has represented Russia 78 times, scoring 5 goals. He began his career at FC Krylia Sovetov Samara before joining Zenit St Petersburg in 2006. Denisov spent six years at Zenit before signing for Dynamo Moscow in 2012. He has been a mainstay in the Dynamo midfield ever since, helping the club to two league titles (2013 & 2015) and three Russian Cups (2013, 2014 & 2016).

Asked about his favourite Dynamo memories, Denisov names the 2013 cup final win over FC Rostov as his most cherished moment with the club:

“It was my first title with Dynamo and it was a very special moment for me. I remember that we played against Rostov who were a very strong side at the time. We were under pressure but we managed to win 1-0 in the end. It was a great feeling to lift the trophy aloft after such a hard-fought match.”

Denisov will be looking to add another trophy to his collection this season as Dynamo currently lie second in the Russian Premier League table behind perennial champions CSKA Moscow. With 10 games remaining, there is still everything to play for and Denisov will be looking to lead his side to glory once again.

Aleksandr Kokorin was born on April 10th 1991 in Moscow, Russia. He started playing football at the age of six, and quickly developed a passion for the game.

Kokorin is an extremely talented striker with an excellent goal scoring record. He has proved himself to be a match winner on numerous occasions – both domestically and internationally – and is sure to continue scoring goals for both Zenit Saint Petersburg and Russia for years to come.
