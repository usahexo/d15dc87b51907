Are you looking to get an edge on your Roulette opponents in Final Fantasy XIV? Just like with most games, the higher levels offer better rewards. In this guide, we’re going to show you how to find the level 50 and level 60 Roulette games in the game!

To start, open up the Duty Finder and select “Random Match” from the sub-menu. After that, you’ll want to choose the “ duties > Roulette > Level 50” or “ duties > Roulette > Level 60” options. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts of “N” for level 50 and “H” for level 60.

Once you’ve done that, you will be placed into a queue and matched up with other players who have selected the same level as you. The great thing about using the Duty Finder is that it always puts you into a full party, so there is no need to scramble to find players to play with!

When you finally enter the dungeon, make sure to talking to one of the moogles near the entrance. This will activate the Roulette wheel and determine which enemies you will be fighting. The great thing about playing at a higher level is that it offers more variety in enemies, making it a more fun and challenging experience.

Make sure to loot any enemies that you kill, as they will drop valuable items and equipment. You can also speak with one of the roulette attendants near each wheel to exchange your tokens for some impressive rewards!

There are a lot of different opinions on where the best place to find a level 50 or level 60 roulette instance is. Some people believe that instances in Orgrimmar or Stormwind provide the best experience, while others think that the Dire Maul instances are better.

The reason for this is because there are a lot of different mobs to fight in the monastery, and it's easy to find a group to join. In addition, there are several different bosses in the Scarlet Monastery that can provide a challenge for players who are looking for an exciting and challenging experience.

#  Quick Tips For Finding a Level 50 or 60 Roulette Instance in FFXIV

Since the introduction of patch 4.05, crafters and gatherers have enjoyed new conveniences with the addition of level 60 gathering nodes and high-level recipes. Similarly, Disciples of War and Magic now have access to new content in the form of level 50 roulette instances. The only problem is locating these instances.

Server Status
The first place to start is the Lodestone, where you can check server status. From there you will want to find an instance that is open by clicking on “Level 50/60 Roulette” under Duty Finder > Party Finder > Instances.

Classes & Roles
Second, you need to make sure your party is properly balanced for the content. Your party should have one tank, two healers, and three DPS. Your roles in a level 50 or 60 roulette instance do not matter as much as your classes do.

Placement Matters
Third, placement in the instance also matters quite a bit. You will want your DPS classes to be as close to the front as possible so they can quickly take down enemies. Tanks should be placed in the middle and healers towards the back. If you are playing a healer or support class, avoid being too far back or you may find yourself out of combat for extended periods of time.


  So you’ve decided that you want to take on some of the tougher end-game content in Final Fantasy XIV but don’t know where to start? Fear not! We are here to help guide you through some key things you need to know before attempting level 50 or 60 roulette instances – which just became available with patch 4.05! 
   The first thing we would recommend doing is checking server status on the Lodestone website – this will give you an indication of which instances are currently open and ready for players. Next, we need to make sure our party is properly balanced for the content; our group should ideally consist of one tank, two healers, and three DPS players. Your roles in a level 50 or 60 roulette instance do not matter as much as your classes do – so feel free to mix it up and try out something new! Finally, placement in the instance also matters quite a bit – DPS players should be positioned at the front so they can quickly take down enemies, tanks should generally be placed in the middle, and healers towards the back. If you are playing a healer or support class, avoid being too far back or you may find yourself out of combat for extended periods of time – depending on your party makeup that may not always be feasible though!
