#  What's Up With Crown Casino Melbourne Vwin!?

In March 2019, Crown Casino Melbourne was acquired by the Hong Kong-based Vwin Group. The $2.3 billion deal is one of the largest in Australian gaming history, and it's left many people wondering what's in store for Crown.

So far, not much has changed at Crown Casino Melbourne. The casino is still open and operational, and the Vwin Group has said that it will not make any major changes until after a construction project that's already underway is completed.

The project in question is a new luxury hotel called The Tower at Crown. Once it's finished, the Vwin Group plans to renovate other parts of the casino as well. So far, however, there are no specific plans for how the renovations will take place or what they will entail.

One thing that is certain is that the Vwin Group has a lot of money to invest in Crown Casino Melbourne.
