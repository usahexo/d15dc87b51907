#  Everton FC Falls to -15 in First Hostile Sports Betting

Everton FC is one of the most popular football clubs in the world and typically has a very loyal fan base. As with any other sport, Everton FC also enjoys having supporters that bet on their games.

In the past, Everton FC was able to maintain a positive betting history, even though they haven’t always been a powerhouse team in the Premier League. However, recently the club has fallen on some hard times and their fans’ betting habits have followed suit.

According to sports betting data analytics company SportRadar, Everton FC has a -15 betting balance so far this season across all markets. This ranks them as the 3rd worst team in the Premier League in terms of how they’ve fared with sports betting this year.

To make matters worse, Everton’s last home game against Chelsea saw them slip to a -7 loss when their fans put money down on them winning (the final score was 2-0 Chelsea). With 4 more matches remaining at Goodison Park this season, it will be interesting to see if Everton can improve their standing at home or if their fans will continue to lose money.

Interestingly, one of the teams that Everton is scheduled to play towards the end of the season is Tottenham Hotspur – who have the best sports betting balance in the Premier League this year. If Spurs can manage to win at Goodison Park, it would not only be a crushing defeat for Everton but would also likely result in even more lost money for their fans.

#  Everton FC Down 2 Goals Early in Hostile Sports Betting

The Everton FC team was looking to rebound after a tough loss last weekend. However, they found themselves down by two goals early on in their game against Watford. This was definitely not the start they were hoping for, and it made the rest of the game much more difficult.

Everton ended up losing the match by a final score of 3-2. This was definitely not the result they were hoping for, and it leaves them with a lot of work to do in order to get back on track.

While Everton may have lost this match, there were still some positives that can be taken away from it. For example, Gylfi Sigurdsson continues to be a force on the offensive end of the field. He scored one goal and added an assist in this match, and he will need to continue to produce if Everton is going to turn things around.

 Additionally, new signing Cenk Tosun looked good in his debut for the club. He didn’t score any goals, but he did provide some good chances for his teammates. If he can continue to build chemistry with Sigurdsson and the other attacking players, then Everton could be in good shape moving forward.

However, there are still plenty of areas that need improvement. The defense was leaky once again in this match, and they will need to shore things up if they want to compete for a spot in the top half of the table. Overall, there is definitely plenty of work left to do for this Everton squad. They will need to start picking up wins soon if they want to avoid being dragged into a relegation battle late in the season.

#  Hornets Sting Everton FC in Hostile Sports Betting

The Hornets successfully stung Everton FC in their last Premier League game, earning them all three points with a 2-1 victory. This was an impressive result, as Everton had only suffered one defeat at home all season leading up to the match.

It was a close game, as both teams exchanged scoring opportunities throughout the ninety minutes. The Hornets finally managed to break through in the seventy-seventh minute with a goal from Roberto Pereyra. Richarlison then sealed the victory for the away side with an insurance goal in stoppage time.

This win is a huge boost for the Hornets, who have now moved up to ninth place in the Premier League table. They are still four points behind Everton, but this victory will give them plenty of confidence as they look to finish the season strong.

Meanwhile, Everton have seen their hopes of qualifying for Europe fade away with this loss. They are now in seventh place in the table, eight points behind Chelsea who currently occupy the final Europa League spot.

The Hornets’ win over Everton was not surprising to sports betting fans, as they were favoured to win by most online betting sites. This is because the Hornets have been playing very well lately, while Everton had been struggling somewhat leading up to this match.

It will be interesting to see if Everton can rebound from this loss and qualify for Europe, or if the Hornets can continue their surge up the table and finish in a European spot themselves.

#  Everton FC Struggles Against Defending Champion in Hostile Sports Betting

After an offseason of great promise, Everton FC opened their Premier League campaign with a tough 2-1 loss against defending champion Chelsea. With new signings such as Gylfi Sigurdsson and Wayne Rooney in the fold, Everton were expected to give Chelsea a challenge, but the Blues defense proved too stout.

As one might expect, this result had an impact on Everton's sports betting odds for the season. The Toffees went from +2200 (22-1) pre-season to +4000 (40-1) after the first game. While they are still considered a longshot to win the title, their odds have lengthened since their disastrous debut.

One bright spot for Everton was the play of Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku. The former Chelsea striker scored his team's only goal and looked dangerous throughout the match. He will be looking to build on that performance in next week's match against Tottenham Hotspur.

Despite Lukaku's efforts, Everton are still a work in progress and will need time to gel as a team. They cannot afford another slow start if they hope to make a serious run at the title.

#  Everton FC Can't Catch a Break in Hostile Sports Betting

It's been a tough season for Everton Football Club. The team can't seem to catch a break in the sports betting world, with nearly every game seeming to end in heartbreak.

One prime example is their match against Liverpool last weekend. The game was neck-and-neck until the last few minutes, when Liverpool successfully scored three goals to secure the victory. This came on the heels of an earlier match against Tottenham Hotspur, where Everton let a 2-0 lead slip away and ended up losing 3-2.

The string of defeats has left the team in 10th place in the Premier League table, well below where they would like to be at this point in the season. To make matters worse, several of their key players are injured or suspended, including captain and striker Wayne Rooney.

 Everton's poor form is also reflected in their odds for winning the Premier League this season. Bovada currently has them at 20/1, which ranks sixth among all teams. For comparison, Manchester City is at 1/4 and Liverpool is at 5/2.

It will be interesting to see how Everton performs in their next few games. They'll be playing teams that are currently lower in the table than them, so there's a chance for them to pick up some much needed points. However, given their track record so far this season, it's hard to be too optimistic about their chances.
